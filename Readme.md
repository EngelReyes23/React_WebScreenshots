# Web Screenshots 📷

It is a small app that requests the URL you want to take a screenshot of

<div style="display:flex; margin:1rem auto">
  <image src='./images/LightMode.jpeg' width='50%'>
  <image src='./images/DarkMode.jpeg'  width='50%'>
</div>

## Usage

You can enter a valid URL that contains http or https, in case the URL does not include it, it will be concatenated by default https

## It's finished ?

The design is still under development 🚀, but the functionality is ready 😁

Later the possibility of being able to choose the background color that frames the image will be added
